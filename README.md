# NestJS Tutorial

- [Udemy Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/nestjs-zero-to-hero/)
- [Udemy Course Repo](https://github.com/arielweinberger/nestjs-course-task-management)

Takeaways:

- This is my first time trying NestJS and I like it!
- I like TypeScript for enforcing code quality and maintainability as projects grow, very cool to add a new way to build an API to my skills
- The framework architecture is scalable and seems easy to understand as a dev who has primarily worked with Ruby on Rails on the backend
- Controller -> Service -> Repository is pretty straightforward
- If you're building a REST API this is clearly a solid way to organize it
- I'm glad this tutorial went through setting up auth since that is vital to any real-world application, JWT is good for distributed systems and mobile apps
- I've used Prisma as an ORM before, I like TypeORM too for having a pretty robust API that makes a lot of common query and mutation types simple to implement
- The tutorial is about 3 years old and the `@EntityRepository` decorator has been deprecated since then, but I was able to find an article that helped me find the current way to make a custom repository
- I feel like I can jump in on any NestJS project now

TODO:

- I stopped right before Section 8 so I want to explore those as well
- I am going to try to build a new demo that has some more real-world entity structure on my own just to see if I got the hang of this

Below is the standard boilerplate readme for creating a NestJS app:
